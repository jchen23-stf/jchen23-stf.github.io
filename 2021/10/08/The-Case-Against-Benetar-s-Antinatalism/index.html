<p>This is an article I wrote in response to David Benatar’s famous philosophy essay <em>Why It Is Better Never To Come Into Existence</em>. In this article, he proves an argument for antinatalism, the ethical view that it is morally wrong to bring children into existence. I would highly recommend reading over his original essay (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/20009904?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=Why+it+is+better+never+to+come+into+existence&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3DWhy%2Bit%2Bis%2Bbetter%2Bnever%2Bto%2Bcome%2Binto%2Bexistence%26acc%3Don%26wc%3Don%26fc%3Doff%26group%3Dnone%26refreqid%3Dsearch%253Aef8f37713d5cb99b4257acfe2679f354&ab_segments=0%2FSYC-6080%2Findeg-test&refreqid=fastly-default%3A4c2164de060c8b3cc891137aa0fca4f3&seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link here</a>).

<h2 id="Benatar’s-argument-for-being-brought-into-existence-is-always-a-harm"><a href="#Benatar’s-argument-for-being-brought-into-existence-is-always-a-harm" class="headerlink" title="Benatar’s argument for being brought into existence is always a harm"></a>Benatar’s argument for being brought into existence is always a harm</h2><p>Central to Benatar’s argument that bringing someone into existence is always a harm is the concept of asymmetry between the absence of “bad” and the absence of “good”. In considering a person who has not been brought into existence, he believes that the absence of “bad” is necessarily a good thing, even if the person does not exist to experience the “bad”, but the absence of “good” is just not bad. The former seems intuitive, and he cites three reasons for the latter: duty, regret, and reason. He appeals to our intuition to support his three claims: First, we feel we have a moral duty to prevent suffering from taking place but do not have a duty to bring more pleasure; second, we tend to regret when we can not prevent suffering from befalling to an individual, but we tend not to feel the same for pleasure; and finally, we tend to avoid bring children who might suffer into this world, but will not give birth to as many children as possible just because there is the prospect of them having pleasures. If one is convinced by his logic and agrees with his appeal to common sense, then it follows being brought into existence is a bad thing.</p>
<p>To further establish that bringing someone into existence is always a harm, notice the definition of harm - X harms Y by doing A such that A brings suffering or decreases the utility of Y, compared to the case when X has not done A. The action here is bringing someone into existence. As Benetar has established through his asymmetry argument, bring someone into existence is increasing the suffering for that person, insofar as we do not consider the positive utility Y can have after being born. Therefore bringing someone into existence is always a harm. </p>
<h2 id="What-would-Benetar-need-to-argue-that-it-is-wrong-to-bring-someone-into-existence"><a href="#What-would-Benetar-need-to-argue-that-it-is-wrong-to-bring-someone-into-existence" class="headerlink" title="What would Benetar need to argue that it is wrong to bring someone into existence?"></a>What would Benetar need to argue that it is wrong to bring someone into existence?</h2><p>So far Benatar has established that bring someone into existence is always a <em>harm</em>. To further establish that it is wrong to bring someone into existence, he needs to show that such harm is both significant and unjustifiable.</p>
<p>First, Benatar believes that the harm of bringing someone into life is significant, as “something as valued as procreation must not be condemned lightly”. Under his asymmetry argument, since all the positive elements of a human life would not be put into the calculation, it is not hard to argue that all the sufferings one experiences in a human life constitute a great harm.</p>
<p>Benatar also believes that this harm is not morally justificable. He points out that parents bring their children into lives often out of their own procreational interests, and of couse without the consent of the newborns. As a result, he concludes that “serving one’s own interests is not always bad. It is often good, but where doing so inflicts significant harm on others, it is not usually justified”. He continues his argument by refuting the two counterarguments. The first argument claims that since parents cannot foresee whether their children will have happy or miserable lives, they bear no moral weight in choosing to bring them to life. Benatar refutes this claim by arguing that even if parents cannot foresee the future, they have a moral duty to make the “cost” of their procreational interests as low as possible, i.e., as little suffering as possible. It then follows that parents who bring miserable human beings into their lives are not justified for doing so. The second argument argues that a significant amount of people do not regret coming into exsitence, so the positive utility experienced by these people justifies their parents from bringing them into existence. Benatar again refutes this claim by using the idea “adaptive preference” - when we are in adversarial conditions, we tend to align our preferences to the situation so that we can feel less bad. An example he uses is that “we would not take slave’s endorsement o his slavery as conclusive evidence that slavery is in his interests,” so in the same way, we should treat people’s enthusiasms for coming into existence with suspicion because we are not able to imagine and compare it with the counterfactual, i.e. not existing. </p>
<h2 id="My-case-against-Benatar’s-argument"><a href="#My-case-against-Benatar’s-argument" class="headerlink" title="My case against Benatar’s argument"></a>My case against Benatar’s argument</h2><p> In the next part, I will provide two arguments again Benetar’s argument for the asymmetry, and one argument against his argument that“at the very least, that it is not morally desirable” to bring someone into existence.</p>
<p>First, in response to Benatar’s formulation of the asymmetry, I argue that we cannot prescribe values to someone/something that does not exist. A central part of his argument of the asymmetry lies in the idea that the absence of bad is always good, even though there is not an existing being to ascribe the potential suffering to. Suppose we can prescribe values to lives that have not been lived, it follows that “good” and “bad” should take equal parts in the utilitarian calculation. Specifically, it would be logically incoherent to argue that the absence of “bad” is good, and the absence of “good” is not bad, as without a being to ascribe the “good” and “bad” to, the two would make no difference in the hypothetical calculation, where “good” is net-positive and “bad” is net-negative. Therefore, in the hypothetical case, the “good” and “bad” dichotomy should be a symmetry, but not an asymmetry. </p>
<p>Second, I will challenge Benatar’s appeal to common values as the basis of his argument for asymmetry. Benatar cites duty, reason, and regret as three common moral intuitions we have, from which he generates his asymmetry argument. It might not be the case. Notice the words “duty” and “regret” are passive in nature, which appeals to the more negative-averse side of our moral reasoning. In thinking about duty and regret, any potential negative outcome tends to trigger the red flag on our moral reasoning, as the dominant cultural discourse has been that we should fulfill our duty and prevent regret. To provide a counterexample, I will establish my own “aspiration” principle - we have an aspiration to bring about happy and fulfilled human beings, and to minimize the pain and suffering of anyone we bring to life. Under this principle, we can say that not bringing a child, who could have a fulfilling life, into existence is against the aspiration principle, and therefore necessarily bad. </p>
<p>Finally, assuming Benatar’s asymmetry does not hold, I will argue that it would not be wrong for parents to bring children into their lives, by appealing to the control principle. The control principle states that we should only be held morally accountable for things that we have control of, and conversely if something is out of our control, we are not morally responsible for the act. In the case of procreation, it can be argued that parents have very little control over whether their children will regret being born into this world. Before continuing the argument, I will concede to Benetar that a parent has a moral responsibility to minimize the suffering that their children may experience. However, while Benetar uses this to argue that parents have control over the well-being of their children (and therefore under his asymmetry they would be morally culpable for intentionally bringing them to life), I will argue that parents should only be held accountable for preparing in the best of their capacities, i.e. making sure the new born’s survival and emotional needs will be met. Anything out of those would be out of the parents’ control, as the degree to which someone is satisfied with their life has little to do with their parents outside the scope of childhood. A seriously handicapped person can still live a perfectly happy life, while a person who has billions in inheritance can still be deeply troubled by their life. <strong>To summarize, insofar as a parent can provide for a newborn reasonably well, their procreational interest would not be morally wrong, as the level of well-being of their children over their lifespan is out of their control.</strong> </p>
