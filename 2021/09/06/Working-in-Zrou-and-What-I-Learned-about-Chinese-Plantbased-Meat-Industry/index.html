class="post-content" id="article-container"><h2 id="Working-in-Zrou"><a href="#Working-in-Zrou" class="headerlink" title="Working in Zrou"></a>Working in Zrou</h2><p>The story started when I saw a job description posted on the Effective China WeChat group. It was a plant-based meat startup hiring interns for business development and product management. Coming from a tech background, I did not seem to be a perfect match for the job, but I reached out and sent my resume anyway. Three months later, I had the most amazing professional experience in my life. </p>
<p>The interesting thing about working in a startup is that you are faced with different challenging everyday. Everyone has multiple roles, and every one has to learn as they do. Because of of this, the learning curve is extremely steep - the first day of my internship I had to learn how to conduct user interview and called 100+ random people, and on the second day I taught myself Python data processing libraries and built a running data analysis pipeline from scratch. </p>
<p>I want to thank Zrou and my amazing colleagues who made this experience possible. I met some of the most friendly and inspiring people at Zrou, who taught me immensely usefully skills and mindsets both in work and in life. I learned so much through the internship, especially on the innovation and market landscape of plant-based meat. I will be sharing my first-hand and second-hand knowledge in this industry in this blog, and feel free to reach out if you want to chat about or correct me!</p>
<h2 id="The-case-for-plant-based-meat"><a href="#The-case-for-plant-based-meat" class="headerlink" title="The case for plant-based meat"></a>The case for plant-based meat</h2><p>I first heard about plant-based meat in high school, where I was browsing the news one day and sew BeyondMeat’s IPO news. The concept was not hard to understand - instead of slaughtering animals to get real meat, scientists could make meat at lab. It was not until I became active in Effective Altruism at Stanford that I started to realize the significance of plant-based meat. Reading several books on animal welfare and talking to some people in the Good Food Institute, I was convinced that planted-based meat is the future. Here’s why:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There could be a drastic moral shift against animal farming in the near future. Over the past centuries, one common trend is that our moral compass keeps expanding - from universal suffrage to ending slavery, societies around the world are constantly pushing the limit of what we consider as equal and dignified beings. That can, and will be, extended to animals too (if you are interested in reading more moral arguments on this case, I would highly recommend Peter Singer’s Animal Liberation!). The scale of animal farming is beyond imagination, as every year, __ chickens and __ cows are raised in terrible conditions, only to be slaughtered and put on supermarket shelves. It is reasonable to believe that there will be a shift in public opinion against animal farming, as this is already happening in some places (mostly EU countries). That shift will drastically increase the demand for alternative proteins, and plant-based meat in the primary option right now. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Climate change is happening, and plant-based eat can help reduce carbon emission. Animal farming takes up __% of global carbon emission (yes cows fart a lot and that’s making the earth warmer!). Reducing animals raised for meat consumptions would help reduce the total carbon emission until we hit the goal of being carbon-neutral. Also less farmed animals means less farm lands for the animals, which means more space for forests and millions of wild animals living in them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Plant-based meat can be healthier. More people are worried about their health than now than any past generations, and people are willing to pay for it. Meat is relatively unhealthy for consumption 1, but with plant-based meat, we can control the nutrition contents. This means less __, which can be more healthy for your body.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="The-case-for-a-Chinese-plant-based-meat-brand"><a href="#The-case-for-a-Chinese-plant-based-meat-brand" class="headerlink" title="The case for a Chinese plant-based meat brand"></a>The case for a Chinese plant-based meat brand</h2><p>I learned  a lot about the market and competitive landscape for plant-based meat in China throughout the experience. Talking to entrepreneurs and scientists working towards making plant-based meat popular in China, I am now convinced that the market is huge and there are yet to be top runners in the game. </p>
<p>For starter, remember China is the biggest market for virtually all consumer goods. With 1.4 billion population and a fast rising middle class, China is and will continue to be a sweet spot for any company vying to introduce their products to new markets. The meat consumption market in China is estimated to be ~__ $ in China in the year 2020. Just taking 1% of that market would be huge for any company. The Chinese plant-based meat market is also a growing one. __</p>
<p>Let’s also not forget that the government plays a huge role in the Chinese market, and promoting plant-based meat fits the government’s agenda. China is increasingly moving towards state intervention in the market economy in recent years, with the government cracking down big tech companies and promoting “common prosperity” as a national strategy, essentially aiming to redistribute wealth in a country that has one fo the world the world’s highest Gini coefficient. While pushing for wealth redistribution, the government is not saving money when it comes to encouraging innovations that will deliver a greener future. </p>
<p>Take electric cars as an example. The government started to subsidize the industry as early as __, with billions of dollars of money pouring into the industry every year, which comes in the form of tax deduction, innovation funds, and even direct cash handouts. The results are significant - within few years, companies like _ and _ rose out of the market and grew like crazy. </p>
<p>I think the once the government sees enough breakthroughs in the R&amp;D, the plant-based meat industry would be the next industry that will be heavily-subsidized by the state, for a couple of reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Food security. Food security has always been a top priority for the Chinese government. Food spending takes up __% of Chinese household spending, and any price change in commodities like port and soy beans would have strong ripple effects on the Chinese economy. The 2019 swine flu _. Plant-based meat would make the protein production much more stable through China’s robust manufacturing sector, with less risks in meat production and food safety. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Growing protein need. It came as surprising to me that an average protein consumption per person in China is much less compared to other countries in Asia and beyond. It is _ % less the the. The trend is keeping up - Chinese people will consume more proteins in the coming years, and plant-based protein can play a huge part in that boost. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Help achieve carbon-neutral goal. The Chinese government has set a 2030 deadline to achieve carbon-neutral, and it is very serious about it. The carbon reduction goal is added to the KPI of government officials at every level, and the last thing like that was birth control (see China’s population trend after the one child-policy). As discusses in the previous section, plant-based meat would be huge in reducing carbon emission, which means governments would have significant incentives to promote the industry.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Incentive to promote domestic plant-based meat product. It is not news that China has been disentangling itself from the west, both politically and commercially. Earlier this year, the Chinese government initiated a massive campaigns promoting domestic brands, and VCs and funds _ to find the next PerfectDiary and Shein. I think the last thing that the government wants to see is ImpossibleMeat and BeyondMeat dominating the Chinese market, making it more vulnerable to the already hostile international environment. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Plant-based-meat-customers-in-China"><a href="#Plant-based-meat-customers-in-China" class="headerlink" title="Plant-based meat customers in China"></a>Plant-based meat customers in China</h2><p>Now let’s get to the customers side of the business. I interviewed 200+ customers who tried Zrou’s plant-based meat products and built customers profiles based on the interviews. While I can’t share the exact numbers, I will give a few general findings that surprised me.</p>
<p>First, who are the customers? To borrow the term from Crossing the Chasm, people who are buying plant-based meat products in China are early adopters. These are the people who are eager to try and test out different products, actively seeking new products in the market. </p>
<p>Why are people trying plant-based meat in China?</p>
<p>What do Chinese customers care about when it comes to plant-based meat?</p>
<h2 id="Challenges"><a href="#Challenges" class="headerlink" title="Challenges"></a>Challenges</h2><ul>
<li>Cost</li>
<li>Customer education</li>
<li>Competition </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Some-thoughts-on-entrepreneurship-in-China"><a href="#Some-thoughts-on-entrepreneurship-in-China" class="headerlink" title="Some thoughts on entrepreneurship in China"></a>Some thoughts on entrepreneurship in China</h2><p>One final thing I want to touch on is entrepreneurship in China. At Zrou, I had the chance to work closely with the founding team, from whom I learned  a lot about the innovation landscape in China and entrepreneurship. </p>
<ul>
<li>The climate is really good right now. Government + capital market. </li>
<li>Connecting the dots. </li>
<li>Rapid iterations and test out hypothesis. </li>
<li>Branding is extremely important. </li>
</ul>
