id="Travel-with-Carina"><a href="#Travel-with-Carina" class="headerlink" title="Travel with Carina"></a>Travel with Carina</h1><p>From time to time I feel itchy feet. I would know it when I start staring at the skyline and browsing Google Earth for no reason. Near the end of my gap year in Beijing, I grew tired of my internship and could no longer suppress that urge anymore. I counted the money I earned from my internship, asked my parents for financial support for a trip to “rediscover myself” (citing Steve Jobs’ trip to India as an example), and embarked on a journey to discover China with Carina, who also happens to have a restless and adventurous soul. </p>
<p>Despite being Chinese, both Carina and I had quite a shallow understanding of the vast Middle Kingdom. I grew up in Guangdong, the southern economic powerhouse on steroid to fill the world’s fantasies about capitalism, while Carina moved to Chicago at a young age and used to believe the entire northeast China is one single province. In case you wonder, it’s the Chinese equivalent of calling Africa a country. </p>
<p>With sheer ignorance and great curiosity, we started our journey in western Hunan (湘西). We traveled with Shan, a human photographer I befriended at Dali. He was on a project to document the stories of rural Chinese people, especially the ethnic minorities. Midway we were also joined by Guanlu, a music phd student and a conductor by training. </p>
<h2 id="Western-Hunan-湘西"><a href="#Western-Hunan-湘西" class="headerlink" title="Western Hunan (湘西)"></a>Western Hunan (湘西)</h2><p>Western Hunan has been a place heavily romanticized throughout modern China. Surrounded by mountains, it has been isolated from the rest of China for hundreds of years. And as a result, many traditions from ancient China remained in the place. When it was discovered by anthropologists a couple decades ago, modern China gazed upon it the same way captain Cook wrote about Tahiti - untamed, barbaric, and exotic. An entire generation of Chinese people grew up reading the story of (边城), a story about __</p>
<p>My fantasy for western Human soon wore off. Not long after we left the highway from airport we found ourselves stranded on a dirt road, blocked by wandering cows and flooded roads. Strange bugs took shelter in our car because of the rain, leaving us with __. Carina, however, was not bothered. She was having fun reading Wikipedia pages of everything about this land. She has the curiosity of a six-year-old. She never stops trying to understand the whats and whys of this world, while the rest of us let our curiosity taken by the mundanity of daily lives and insecurity of ignorance. She was having a good time - Shan and Guanlu had unlimited knowledge to share about China and classical music.  </p>
<p>As we drove between the mountains and fields, we would stop by villages to walk around and chat with the natives. With years of experiences all across the world, Shan is very good at breaking ice and starting conversations with strangers, even ones that don’t share the same language. He would walk to groups of people hanging out in the village, hand every adult a cigarette and every child a candy, and joyfully join their debates about crops yields and gossips about moral decays in the neighboring villages. It was near the end of the trip that I learned of his magic - it was mutual curiosity and story-sharing. He told me that the villagers were as curious about our lives in big cities as we are curious about theirs, and the exchange of stories always produce good conversations. </p>
<p><img src= "/img/loading.gif" data-src="/images/IMG_7599.HEIC" alt=""></p>
<p>One of the villages we visited is called High Chair (高椅), as it is positioned like a high chair in the mountains. The elders in the village told us that their ancestors moved to the village during Yuan Dynasty (~1300 CE) to avoid the Mongols. The village was filled with old buildings and temples - they had been there for hundreds of years with no one knowing their true ages. Though small, the village was designed to be a maze, with convoluted alleyways connecting different parts of the villages. A local can easily navigate to visit a friend’s family at the other side of the village, but strangers would most likely find themselves lost between the brick walls and painted galleries. This designed has saved the village from the plumage of robbers and invaders over the centuries, and I suspect children had also found great joy playing hide-and-seek over the years. </p>
<p>As we were walking in the village, we were greeted by elders chatting and children playing, and it felt as though all the adults were gone. This was not unique to the village - all over China, the rural youth has been migrating to urban centers for better economic opportunities on a scale unparalleled in human history, leaving the elders and children behind in their native villages. Also because of the massive migration, Chinese villages have been disappearing, along with their rich traditions and cultures. </p>
<p>The next day we drove around the region, visiting the remnants of old China. When we were driving out  a village, we were surprised to find a house lying at the periphery, with two elders sitting in the porch and cutting bamboos. The owner of the house welcomed us with cucumbers he planted and fresh-made bamboo chairs for us to sit on. Communication was difficult because of the language difference, but we were able to hear some stories of his life while helping him with the bamboo work. </p>
<p>The owner of the house was an even-tempered person. The other person was his friend, who lived across the mountain and came by everyday to spend time together. He owner had two daughters, both of who left the village after getting married. His wife died a couple years ago. After her death, her daughters tried to convince him to move to the city, but he insisted to stay on this old shackle that he hand-built 30 years ago. He was very stubborn - he refused to see the local officials coming to help him in the poverty eradication campaign (扶贫). He also lived away from the rest of the village, for reason one can only suspect from his stubborn nature. </p>
<p>He has been living a mostly self-reliant life. He plants his own rice and vegetables, with occasional protein intake when his friend brings pork. He hand-made everything in his living space using bamboo, from chairs to toys with fading colors. </p>
<p>“What would you do if you get sick?” It reckoned to me that modern medicine is one thing that no one can escape. </p>
<p>“I’ll die,” he spoke the words with such a relieving smile that it almost felt like he was looking forward to it. He then pointed to the second floor of his shack, signaling us to see it. When we made it to the second floor through a ladder, we saw something laying in the dark. It was a coffin he made for himself. </p>
<p>Poverty could not be unseen in Western Hunan. Despite the government’s tremendous effort to eradicate it, many people were still living poor. We visited a couple other villages in the following villages, and every place we go we are heard of stories of being stuck in the mountains (困在大山里). There was another household with one parent disabled and the other one with Alzheimer’s, and could not receive the poverty relief fund because the parent with Alzheimer’s is considered as “able-body”. People see poverty differently: the central government sees it as a problem to fix; the local official sees it as a key task for their promotion within the party; </p>
<h2 id="Guizhou-贵州"><a href="#Guizhou-贵州" class="headerlink" title="Guizhou (贵州)"></a>Guizhou (贵州)</h2><p>After a couple days in western Hunan we drove west to Guizhou, where we hoped to explore the ethnic minorities communities. One would easily think that China is a monolith of Han Chinese. While that is true to some extent, as Han Chinese takes up nearly 90% of the population, there are still people with diverse cultures and languages residing in mostly remote areas. Upon the founding of the nation, the Party adopted Soviet Union’s policy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korenizatsiya" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Korenizatsiya</a> and designated 55 ethnic minority groups. Most of the ethic groups have their own languages, __</p>
<p>As we passed through the province boarder, we found ourselves surrounded by the mountains, the typical Guizhou landscape. The villages lied sporadically in the valleys, isolated from each other if it the road were not there. We spent the night at Libo(荔波), the capital of the Qiandongnan region (黔东南) that we were visiting. The city was beyond bizarre when we traveled through the mountains and saw it for the first time. Squatting in the valley of the neighboring mountain ranges, the city has all its buildings delineated with colorful lights, as if all the skyscrapers are not enough to showcase its only existing trace of modernity in the mountains. We had very delicious roasted fish at a local restaurant, though it was probably the most spicy fish I ever tried. </p>
<p>We spent the rest of our stay in Guizhou visiting villages. The first one we discovered was a Dong village (侗寨). At first glance, the setup of the village is very different from any villages we had visited by far. The village has a couple brick towers as centers, and the households spiraled around the towers, forming several concentric circles all the way to the edge of the valley, As we approached the towers, we learned that they are mini community-centers - there was a fire pit at the center, and people from different households were hanging out in them, Their formal name is wind-and-rain tower (风雨塔). As the name suggests, it is used to shield people from bad weather, when the locals would stop farming and gather in the tower as a community. I suspected the tower also has religious connotation, as the design reminded me of some of the ancient Chinese mythical stories, but I was not able to find anything to sustain my hypothesis. </p>
<p>Life at the village was slow but organized. The Dong people (侗民) have lived in the land for hundreds of years, and they know the very details of the environment that they survive on - its weather, its living organisms, and its way-of-living. For generations that have harvested their crops, fed their animals, and worshiped their folk gods. Unlike their urban counterparts, life for them is not something to figure out but to live in accordance with the norms and traditions. I wondered whether that was why none of the ancient Chinese philosophers were puzzled by the meaning of life. One is only able to ponder upon the meaning of her life by reflecting on herself from the outside, that is, outside of her existence, That was something that the Chinese philosophers did not bother to try - </p>
<p>Later that day a villager invited us to a rehearsal. When we entered the room, I was stunned by the singing - it was not only beautiful, but also powerful. I could not understand the lyrics and it was later that I learned it was a love song a girl wrote to express her bittersweet crush for a boy. The emotions were flowing in the music. They were actually rehearsing for a performance in the National Opera the coming month. </p>
<h2 id="Guangxi-广西"><a href="#Guangxi-广西" class="headerlink" title="Guangxi (广西)"></a>Guangxi (广西)</h2><p>The next day we decided to make a detour to Guangxi to see the terrace. </p>
<p>We saw a Christian church on our way. </p>
<p>I was stupid enough to drank the water from it. </p>
<p>I took a class at Stanford about rural America, and one common theme across all topics was loneliness - it was so widespread in rural America and the number one health issue. I thought rural China would be the same because of the same scarcity of population. It turned out it was completely different. </p>
