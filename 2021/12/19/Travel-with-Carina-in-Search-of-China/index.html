class="post-content" id="article-container"><h2 id="Travel-with-Carina"><a href="#Travel-with-Carina" class="headerlink" title="Travel with Carina"></a>Travel with Carina</h2><p>From time to time I would feel the urge to move, often without a purpose in mind. The urge creeps in and tells me to get out. I know it when I would start staring at the skyline for no reason and daydream about traveling. Near the end of my gap year in Beijing, I grew tired of my internship and could no longer suppress that urge anymore. I counted the money I earned from my internship, asked my parents for financial support for a trip to “rediscover myself” (citing Steve Jobs’ trip to India as an example), and embarked on a journey to discover China with Carina, who also happens to have a restless and adventurous soul. </p>
<p>Despite being Chinese, both Carina and I had quite a shallow understanding of the vast Middle Kingdom. I grew up in Guangdong, the southern economic powerhouse on steroid to fill the world’s fantasies about capitalism, while Carina moved to Chicago at a young age and used to believe the entire northeast China is one single province. </p>
<p>With sheer ignorance and great curiosity, we started our journey in western Hunan (湘西). We traveled with Shan, a human photographer I befriended at Dali. He was on a project to document the stories of rural Chinese people, especially the ethnic minorities. Midway we were also joined by Guanlu, a phd student studying music who was trying to capture rural folk musics. </p>
<h2 id="Western-Hunan-湘西"><a href="#Western-Hunan-湘西" class="headerlink" title="Western Hunan (湘西)"></a>Western Hunan (湘西)</h2><p>Western Hunan has been a place heavily romanticized throughout modern China. Surrounded by mountains, it has been isolated from the rest of China for hundreds of years. And as a result, many traditions from ancient China remained in the place. When it was discovered by anthropologists a couple decades ago, modern China gazed upon it the same way captain Cook wrote about Tahiti - untamed, barbaric, and exotic. An entire generation of Chinese people grew up reading the story of (边城), a story about __</p>
<p>My fantasy for western Human soon wore off. Not long after we left the highway from airport we found ourselves stranded on a dirt road, blocked by wandering cows and flooded roads. Strange bugs took shelter in our car because of the rain, leaving us with __. Carina, however, was bothered by none of those. She was having fun reading Wikipedia pages of everything about this land. She has the curiosity of a six-year-old. She never stops trying to understand the whats and whys of this world, while the rest of us let our curiosity be killed by the mundanity of daily lives and insecurity of our ignorance. She was having a good time - Shan and Guanlu had unlimited knowledge to share about China and classical music.  </p>
<p>As we drove between the mountains and fields, we would stop by villages to walk around and chat with the natives. With years of experiences all across the world, Shan is very good at breaking ice and starting conversations with strangers, even ones that don’t share the same language. He would walk to groups of people hanging out in the village, hand every adult a cigarette and every child a candy, and joyfully join their debates about corps yields and gossips about moral decays in the neighboring villages. It was near the end of the trip that I learned of his magic - it was mutual curiosity and story-sharing. He told me that the villagers were as curious about our lives in big cities as we are curious about theirs, and the exchange of stories always produce good conversations. </p>
<p>One of the villages we visited is called High Chair (高椅), as it is positioned like a high chair in the mountains. The elders in the village told us that their ancestors moved to the village during Yuan Dynasty (~1300 CE) to avoid the Mongols. The village was filled with old buildings and temples - they had been there for hundreds of years with no one knowing their true ages. Though small, the village was designed to be a maze, with convoluted alleyways connecting different parts of the villages. A local can easily navigate to visit a friend’s family at the other side of the village, but strangers would most likely find themselves lost between the brick walls and painted galleries. This designed has saved the village from the plumage of robbers and invaders over the centuries, and I suspect children had also found great joy playing hide-and-seek over the years. </p>
<p>As we were walking in the village, we were greeted by elders chatting and children playing, and it felt as though all the adults were gone. This was not unique to the village - all over China, the rural youth has been migrating to urban centers for better economic opportunities on a scale unparalleled in human history, leaving the elders and children behind in their native villages. Also because of the massive migration, Chinese villages have been disappearing, along with their rich traditions and cultures. </p>
<p>The next day we drove around the region, visiting the remnants of old China. When we were driving out  a village, we were surprised to find a house lying at the periphery, with two elders sitting in the porch and cutting bamboos. The owner of the house welcomed us with cucumbers he planted and fresh-made bamboo chairs for us to sit on. Communication was difficult because of the language difference, but we were able to hear some stories of his life while helping him with the bamboo work. </p>
<p>Poverty could not be unseen in Western Hunan. Despite the government’s tremendous effort to eradicate it, many people were still living poor. While many try to change their circumstances through migrating for work or investing in their children’s education, there are always one who are left to survive on their own. </p>
<h2 id="Guangxi-广西"><a href="#Guangxi-广西" class="headerlink" title="Guangxi (广西)"></a>Guangxi (广西)</h2><p>We saw a Christian church on our way. </p>
<p>I took a class at Stanford about rural America, and one common theme across all topics was loneliness - it was so widespread in rural America and the number one health issue. I thought rural China would be the same because of the same scarcity of population. It turned out it was completely different. </p>
