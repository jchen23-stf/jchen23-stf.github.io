I can still remember the mixed feeling of excitement and anxiety then I first landed in California - the land of sunshine, wide highways, In&amp;Outs, and where I will call home for the next four years. The adjusting process was brutal, but I was lucky enough to receive help from my peers and mentors. When things are getting better, the pandemic hit. The campus wad emptied in a week, and I ended up living and studying in my dorm room for the whole spring. Looking backwards from now, I don’t know how exactly I would characterize my first year at Stanford -perhaps a mixture of bittersweet, excitement, failures, and doubts?</p>
<h2 id="Class-Highlights"><a href="#Class-Highlights" class="headerlink" title="Class Highlights"></a>Class Highlights</h2><p>Classes at Stanford are amazing. Because of the one university policy, I was virtually able to enroll in any class except wine-tasting and social dance - two of the most popular classes at Stanford. I decided to take a variety of classes as in different departments, class sizes, and formats. All of the classes were extremely rewarding - I was able to learn in and out of class room. Here are some of the highlights from the year. </p>
<h3 id="SLE-Structural-Liberal-Education"><a href="#SLE-Structural-Liberal-Education" class="headerlink" title="SLE - Structural Liberal Education"></a>SLE - Structural Liberal Education</h3><p>SLE is the Stanford’s version of core liberal arts education. It is an 8-unit class, spanning all three quarters of freshman year, and also a residential program - students who are taking the classes live together in three connected dorms. The curriculum was designed to cover the western cannon, from Plato to Sartre, with additional texts such as the Analects and the Quran. I really like the community and atmosphere at SLE. It really was a wholistic humanities learning experiments - we meet every week to discuss and sometimes criticize the texts, watch old movies, and talk about politics and cultures. I felt like reading the Bible, the troubadours, Marx, Du Bois, had a major impact in my thinking. And it is surprising to see how they all relate to our modern existence - Gilgamesh to humankind’s quest for meaning and achievement, Sappho and troubadours to erotics and love, Nietzsche to morality, Arendt to our apathy and atrocities, Marx to alienation, Sartre to a meaningless life, to list a few. </p>
<h3 id="CS106B-Programming-Abstractions"><a href="#CS106B-Programming-Abstractions" class="headerlink" title="CS106B - Programming Abstractions"></a>CS106B - Programming Abstractions</h3><p>CS106B is Stanford’s introductory CS class on algorithms and data structures. The class covers most of the basics - array, map, linked list, recursion, backtracking, binary search tree - all the staff you need for a tech company interview. I would say the class was designed very well. The lectures are very interactive (though most students only watch videos after the first few lectures); the sections are well-taught and encouraging; and the assignments are really cool in terms of what you can accomplish as a beginner in programming. One of the assignment was to design a fake NLP bot  that spits out gibberish that sounds like Shakespeare - and we were able to accomplish that with simple use of maps and sliding-window algorithm. Besides the actual stuff, one thing that I really appreciate from this class is resilience. Unlike other disciplines, most CS assignments are a question of yes-or-no: either your code works or not. And to make your code work you have to spend a lot of time designing and redesigning our algorithms, testing, debugging, which you have no idea would take how much time. To be honest I was very frustrated in the beginning of quarter because of this class, but I have since learned to adapt a growth mindset and ask for help - both of which turn out to be incredibly helpful in other classes and my life. </p>
<h3 id="ECON-1-Principles-of-Economics"><a href="#ECON-1-Principles-of-Economics" class="headerlink" title="ECON 1 - Principles of Economics"></a>ECON 1 - Principles of Economics</h3><p>ECON 1 is Stanford’s introductory economics class, covering micro and macro economics, labor economics, and basics of econometrics. I would highly recommend any college freshman to take at least one Econ class in their first year - it really gives you a perspective in term of how our modern world is organized. The class is very well-taught - Professor Duggan was very good at balancing the quantitative and qualitative parts of the class, which helped me gain both a wholistic overview of the economies around the world as well as inner mechanisms that might impact them. The exams are a bit tricky, but at the same time they help you find weak spots and gaps in your knowledge. </p>
<h3 id="Designing-Your-Stanford"><a href="#Designing-Your-Stanford" class="headerlink" title="Designing Your Stanford"></a>Designing Your Stanford</h3><p>Designing Your Stanford is a class offered by Stanford Design School (dschool). It is essentially a product design class - the product being our experience at Stanford. It is a highly interactive class, where we work in groups to study and explore the fundamental of product designs, brainstorming, decision making, and teamwork. We conducted user experience interviews with upperclass students and professors, reflected upon our past journeys, and try to learn more about ourselves from the reflection. I knew myself a lot better after the class - through reflecting upon myself and talking to others, and I also learn how to engage and emphasize with others through active listening and story sharing. Another big thing I got from the class is visual thinking - it opened up a brand new way of thinking and learning for me, which really helped me grow even after the class.  </p>
<h2 id="Outside-Classrooms"><a href="#Outside-Classrooms" class="headerlink" title="Outside Classrooms"></a>Outside Classrooms</h2><p>Enough for the classes at this point. As well-taught and inspiring they are, I feel like a lot of my learning and growth also happens outside of the classrooms. So in the following sections I would like to talk about what I have learned outside of classes. </p>
<h3 id="Effective-Altruism"><a href="#Effective-Altruism" class="headerlink" title="Effective Altruism"></a>Effective Altruism</h3><p>I encountered Effective Altruism in a very random way. I signed up and went to a talk by Professor Will McAskill from Oxford, and it blew my mind. I remembered Professor McAskill talked about the idea of doing the most good, and how that can be accomplished in many ways- alleviating extreme poverty, addressing farm animal suffering, preventing human extinction, and working on future people’s well-being. Those ideas were completely new to me, yet they present really compelling philosophical arguments about what should I do with my life. </p>
<p>Effective altruism stems from recognizing our scope insensitivity - that due to evolution we have limited capacity for caring. We are accustomed to care about our family, friends, and our “imagined communities,” but we are not good at caring for children suffering from malaria from the other side of the world or chickens being confined to tiny cages. Yet their sufferings are as real as those who are close to us, if not more acute and persistent. If we believe the moral thing to do is to decrease suffering as much as possible, then the logical conclusion is that we have obligations to help people and animals we don’t know, even if we have limited capacity in caring for them. The logic is simple but has profound implications. How should be measure suffering? What are the most effective ways to eliminate suffering? How should be trade our today’s well-being to that of future generations? I think it’s thinking over these questions that makes EA really compelling and engaging. </p>
<p>I have gained a lot from EA. The first and foremost being that it helps me find my mission. I was very lost when I came to Stanford - after scrambling through standardized tests and college applications, I could not where my life is leading me to. Sure with the privilege of a Stanford education I can probably go into a high-income career, after which I can climb the corporate ladder and live a happy life under the social norms - having a family, traveling around the world, giving back to my community. However, this is something lackluster about this way of life; specifically it does not excite me about moving on with the next chapter of my life. EA, on the other hand, provides a silver lining. I can spend my life trying to do the most good, whether through donating to the most effective charities, working on global priorities research, or even convincing more people to do good. This feels tangible to me - every bit of effort I take may lead to less suffering, thus a better world. With this mission in mind I am starting to feel a lot motivated about my life. </p>
<h3 id="One-for-the-World"><a href="#One-for-the-World" class="headerlink" title="One for the World"></a>One for the World</h3><p>I was introduced to One for the World from another friend in Stanford EA. One for the World was a world-wide student organization focus on encouraging students to pledge to donate one percent of their future income to the most effective charities as recommended by GiveWell - which includes Anti-Malaria Foundation, Helen Keller Foundation and more. The rationale comes from effective altruism - <strong>you should try to do the most good possible with relatively low cost to yourself</strong> One can imagine their life will not have major changes after donating one percent of their income, yet the donation could be huge for people living in extreme poverty. </p>
<p>My passion for global development stems from a thought experiment called the drowning child analogy proposed by philosopher Peter Singer. Its gist goes as this: if we would not hesitate to save a drowning child we see at the cost of damaging a $50 shoes we are wearing, it make no sense not to donate $50 to the most effective charities, which may also save a child in the least developed regions. The amount of “drowning children” around the world are beyond our comprehension, yet not enough is done for them. </p>
<p>People often consider themselves moral - we would not hesitate to help our family and friends, or condemn the racists or sexists. Yet it is strange that very few people actually set up donation plans for the least advantaged people in the world despite the fact that no one would disagree it is the moral thing to do. There are a lot of explanations for this - diffusion of responsibility, by-stander effect, scope insensitivity, and they all fall under the reasoning that we reply on our feeling, or more specifically compassion, to do good. I was quite frustrated when I learned about this fact. I think the problem is not that people are not having enough compassion - modern psychology has proven that we only have a limited amount of capacity for caring - but the fact that people using reason to guide their good-doing. Even though we cannot feel a strong emotional connection to people from the other side of the world, we still have compelling moral incentive to help them anyway. </p>
<p>At his point we are starting to organize our efforts to encourage effective giving. We are planning a variety of social and speaker events for the fall, and we are also collaborating with Stanford Federal Credit Union to encourage students to donate $25 of their referral benefits. Our goal is to make the donation pledge a Stanford tradition. Studies have shown that people are more likely to start and continue their donation when people around them are also donating. Our hope is to create such a community in Stanford where the culture of giving would help students to start their donation journey. </p>
<h2 id="Life"><a href="#Life" class="headerlink" title="Life"></a>Life</h2><h3 id="Stanford-dUcK-SYndRoMe"><a href="#Stanford-dUcK-SYndRoMe" class="headerlink" title="Stanford dUcK SYndRoMe"></a>Stanford dUcK SYndRoMe</h3><p>For starter, this is a very real thing. Under the glaze of Californian sunshine and Stanford’s active campus culture everything and everyone looks glamorous - a group of talented young students gathering in one of the best institutions in the world striving to build a better future in for the humanity. Yet under this facade mental issues are real. I had very tough times in my first year, and so did friends I talked to. But people don’t tend to share those things outside their friends. So I end up feeling like everyone was thriving in Stanford but me, which of course was not a pleasant feeling.</p>
<p>Talking with friends helps. In my most difficult moments, I was fortunate enough to have friends and family I could talk to, and through talking to them, I realized that no one’s life is easy. People are vulnerable in many different ways, but we often times we choose not to share those vulnerabilities. I think one important thing Stanford has taught me is how to live in a community - where I can be vulnerable and support others who are feeling vulnerable. </p>
<p>If you are new to Stanford, you should also take some time to learn about the mental resources at Stanford, like Bridge or CAPS. Those places are help and there are a lot of people ready to help you - it’’s never too late to ask for help! </p>
<h3 id="Meditation"><a href="#Meditation" class="headerlink" title="Meditation"></a>Meditation</h3><p>Meditation has been a suprising habbit that I developed over my freshman year. I had experiecne with meditations before - I tried doing meditations with apps like Headspace and Calm, but it was really at Stanford that it became a habbit. Stanford has a meditation center called the Windhover (the name comes from the poem by Gerard Manley Hopkins). It became my go-to place when I felt stressed or anxious and realized I could not control my emotion. Simply staying at the place helped me focus more on my thoughts. Instead of actively resisting my emotions and thoughts, I learned how to accept them - which turns out to be a very powerful tool for managing my life. </p>
<p>One exercise that I tried a lot was the simple breathing exercise. I would simply count my breath from 1 to 100, and if my thoughts wander, I would start over. It helped me focus on my thoughts and trained my ability to actively communicate with my inner feelings. I tried other meditation techniques as well in other meditation programs and traditions, but I would say the techniques matter less if you just want to try out meditation - all you need to do is just to start!</p>
<h2 id="Mindsets-I-Try-to-Develop"><a href="#Mindsets-I-Try-to-Develop" class="headerlink" title="Mindsets I Try to Develop"></a>Mindsets I Try to Develop</h2><h3 id="Resilience"><a href="#Resilience" class="headerlink" title="Resilience"></a>Resilience</h3><p>Resilience is the number one skill that students should train themselves with at college. As I am still practicing with it till this day, the ability to accept and learn from your setbacks is an immensely powerful skill to add to your life toolkit. There are times when I  simply could not feel other things than frustration and loss, such as when I found out my code has a bug that I don’t know how to fix. But it turns out that most of the time learning takes place exactly in such occasions. When you are in frustration, your natural reaction would be to reflect on what caused the frustration and how to avoid it. If you do it in the right way, that is, without mentally torturing yourself, you can actually learn a great deal from your mistakes. </p>
<p>I suspect the reason that many people, myself included, lack resilience has something to do with the lack of positive feedbacks. Positive feedbacks were relatively easy to achieve back in high school, when everyone’s path is relatively linear and the rules are set for you to compete. Whereas in college, things become harder and less predictable, and when facing setbacks, people can easily doubt whether the path they are taking is the right one for them. This is also why it is so important to build your resilience in college, as you may face even more uncertainty and less positive feedback loops when you are exploring your own path. </p>
<h3 id="Mental-flow"><a href="#Mental-flow" class="headerlink" title="Mental flow"></a>Mental flow</h3><p>I was introduced to the idea after reading the book Flow, and it has a lasting impact on me. Mental flow is defined to be a psychological state where individuals feel content and motivated to finish their tasks on hand, oftentimes with full occupation and devotion. There is a wonderful article on <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/one-among-many/201502/flow-and-happiness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Psychology Today</a> that explains what this stage is. </p>
<p>I find myself in the flow when I am coding or writing, as both require creativity and can be managed within my abilities. At the same time, I have been trying to design a work flow that helps me enter the flow stage more easily. Specifically, I have been thinking about how to reduce the mental friction of transitioning into work, manage my expectation of difficulty, and adjust my habits to make the learning curve steeper for me. I will write a blog post about this once I finish designing it and experience it for some time. </p>
